<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p>In the preparation of this little volume much depended upon the
kindness and generosity of certain Oriental scholars, who have allowed
me to reproduce some of their translations from Jámí. I have attempted
to give their best work in so far as it tends to illustrate the
mystical teaching of the last great poet of Persia.</p>

<p>Once more I am indebted to Mr. E. H. Whinfield for permission to
quote from his translation of the <i>Lawá'ih</i> (Oriental Translation
Fund, New Series, vol. xvi., Royal Asiatic Society, London). I have
to thank Prof. Edward G. Browne for allowing me to use his beautiful
translation from <i>Yúsuf and Zulaikha</i>, which I have called "The Coming
of the Beloved." This translation appears, in fuller form, in Prof. E.
G. Browne's article on "Súfíism" in <i>Religious Systems of the World</i>
(Sonnenschein). The chapter in the present volume entitled "The Story
of Yúsuf and Zulaikha" originally appeared in the <i>Orient Review</i>,
and I am indebted to the editors for their courtesy in allowing me
to reproduce it here. I very much appreciate Mr. E. Edwards's kindly
interest in my work, and for the valuable suggestions he has made from
time to time. I tender my thanks to Messrs. Kegan Paul for allowing me
to make a selection from <i>Yúsuf and Zulaikha</i>, translated by the late
Mr. Ralph T. Griffith (Trübner's Oriental Series).</p>

<p>The translations from <i>Salámán and Absál</i> are by Edward FitzGerald,
and those from the <i>Baháristán</i> were originally published by the Kama
Shastra Society.</p>

<h4>EDITORIAL NOTE</h4>

<p>The object of the editors of this series is a very definite one. They
desire above all things that, in their humble way, these books shall be
the ambassadors of good-will and understanding between East and West,
the old world of Thought, and the new of Action. In this endeavour,
and in their own sphere, they are but followers of the highest example
in the land. They are confident that a deeper knowledge of the great
ideals and lofty philosophy of Oriental thought may help to a revival
of that true spirit of Charity which neither despises nor fears the
nations of another creed and colour.</p>

<h4><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>
<hr class="r5" />
<h4><a id="I_THE_LIFE_OF_JAMI"></a>I. THE LIFE OF JÁMÍ</h4>

<p>Nur-addín 'Abd-alrahmán Jámí was born in Jám<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the 23rd of Sha'bán,
817, <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span> (Nov. 7, 1414 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span>), and died at Herát the 18th of Muharram,
898 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span> (Nov. 9, 1492 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.D.</span>). Dr. Hermann Ethé gives Khasjird, near
Jám, as the birthplace of the poet; but as Jámí himself refers more
than once to the fact of Jám being his birthplace, we must give the
poet the benefit of the doubt and I trust to his good memory in the
matter. The fact that Jám and Khasjird are in close proximity I has
probably given rise to confusion in the matter. It will be evident that
the poet took his name from the first-mentioned town.</p>

<p>In 822 <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A.H.</span> Khwájah Mohammad Pársá happened to pass through the little
town of Jám, <i>en route</i> for Hijàz. A great concourse of people came out
to do the holy man honour, and among them was the little boy, Jámí, and
his father. A pretty story is told of how Jámí's father seated his son
in front of Khwájah's litter. I do not think the little fellow laughed
very much, as most boys would have done on such a joyous occasion,
because Jámí, writing on his impression of that day sixty years after,
tells us that "The pure refulgence of his (Mohammad Pársá's) beaming
countenance is even now, as then, clearly visible to me, and my heart
still feels the joy I experienced from that happy meeting. I firmly
believe that that bond of union, friendship, confidence, and love,
which subsequently bound the great body of pious spirits to this humble
creature, is wholly due to the fortunate influence of his glance, and
most devoutly do I trust that the auspiciousness of this union may
cause me to be ranked among the number of his friends." Jámí seems to
have had much faith in the contact with holy men, and he attached much
importance to a certain Shaikh who took him on his knee as a child.
This very estimable reverence for holy men and holy things must ever
remain as one of the poet's finest characteristics. We can, however,
never say of Jámí that he was a man of wide sympathy. He was kind and
generous towards the poor and needy; but he lamentably failed where,
perhaps, he should have shone most, namely, among the literary men of
his own period. He too frequently displayed a fighting spirit, where
tolerance and a willingness to admit of another point of view would
have shown to greater advantage.</p>

<p>Jámí commenced his education at Herát. He strongly objected to the
disciplinary methods of instruction, was not studious as a boy, and
preferred games rather than the study of books. But he was naturally
clever, naturally quick at absorbing knowledge with a minimum of
labour. It is said of him that he used to snatch a book from one of his
fellow students while on his way to school and excel them all when they
were examined in class.</p>

<p>Jámí soon left his instructor Mullá Junaid and became a pupil of
Khwájah 'Alí al-Samarqandi. Jámí was so brilliant a scholar that
after forty lessons further instruction from his master was quite
unnecessary. After attending a series of lectures by Qazí Rúm, at
Samarqand, he succeeded in getting the best of an argument with the
learned professor who had given the lectures. It might have been
expected that the defeat of an older man of letters than Jámí would
have produced ill-feeling; but quite the contrary was the case.
Qazí Rúm, before a large assembly, described Jámí thus: "Since the
building of this city, no one equal, in sharpness of intellects and
power of using them, to young Jámí, has ever crossed the Oxus and
entered Samarqand." This was high praise indeed; but though it awakens
our admiration, the fact that he dispensed with "home-work" while
at school, scanned his lessons while walking past the rose-gardens,
bettered his instructor in an argument, and in every way shone as a
most clever young man, because he simply could not help being anything
else, makes him not one whit dearer to our hearts if we expect from him
something more than cleverness. Jámí had not that greatness of soul
whereby to counteract the deterrent effect his conspicuous success
might have upon him. In these early days of too youthful recognition we
find Jámí infected with that disease commonly known as "swelled head,"
from which the poet never recovered. We see him too often as a little
tin-god denying, with the exception of his father, all indebtedness to
others for his noteworthy erudition&mdash;an absurd attitude for any one
to take. He remarks: "I have found no master with whom I have read,
superior to myself. On the contrary I have invariably found that,
in argument, I could defeat them all. I acknowledge, therefore, the
obligations of a pupil to his master to none of them; for if I am the
pupil of any one, it is of my father who taught me the language." This
blatantly conceited attitude is both disappointing and surprising
when we remember first, that Jámí was a professed Súfí, the follower
of a teaching the tenets of which are the abandonment of self and the
knowledge of God only. Second, that Jámí had a very decided sense of
humour, strongly in evidence in the "Sixth Garden" of his <i>Baháristán</i>,
so delightfully entitled: "Blowing of the zephyrs of wit and the
breezes of jocular sallies, which cause the buds of the lips to laugh
and the flowers of the hearts to bloom." From these two things alone we
might have expected a finer and nobler character. We must be, however,
content with the life of a great literary egoist, abandon sentiment,
and remember only that he has left to posterity the most polished of
Persian poetry.</p>

<p>Jámí's acceptance of Súfíism was brought about through a vision in
which S'ad al-Dín appeared to him and said: "Go, O child! and wait
on one who is indispensable to you." As this message was delivered
by a spirit Jámí appears to have taken no objection to the word
"indispensable"; but on the contrary, obeyed the command and went to
S'ad al-Dín for spiritual instruction. Under this holy man Jámí lived
the life of a rigid ascetic. So devoutly and so strenuously did Jámí
perform his penances that when S'ad al-Dín thought fit to lessen them
and allow Jámí to mix with society again, the poet found that he had
lost his power of eloquence, for which he had been so justly famed,
and it was some considerable time before he regained his position as a
great master of rhetoric.</p>

<p>I have already said that Jámí showed a very strong liking for holy
and pious men. Particularly might be mentioned Shams al-Dín Mohammad
Asad and 'Ubaid Ullah Ahrár. The last mentioned alludes to Jámí as
the "flood of light," and to himself as the "small lamp." But Jámí,
nevertheless, was not very optimistic in his views regarding other
people. "Alas," said he, "I can find no seekers after <i>Truth</i>. Seekers
there are, but they are seekers of their own prosperity."</p>

<p>It was while making a pilgrimage to Mecca that Jámí suffered
considerably from the mutilation of a passage from his <i>Silsilah
al-Dhahab</i>, a passage purposely borrowed from Qazí Azád. The mutilation
was performed by N'imat-i Haidarí, a native of Jám, who had accompanied
Jámí to Baghdad, had quarrelled, and left the little band and some
Moslims of another order. The partially suppressed passage was shown to
some of the Shí'a as the work of Jámí. The poet and his followers met
with a heated dispute from the people of Baghdad. Finally a meeting was
called in the Madrassah of the town. A large number of excited people
attended. The Hanafi and Sháfi'í churches were represented, and in
front of their respective representatives sat the Governor. When the
<i>Silsilah al-Dhahab</i> was perused the piece of deception was discovered,
namely, that the beginning and end had been suppressed, and a passage
added likely to offend the people of Baghdad. Peace was once more
restored. Jámí, however, felt justified in punishing the originators
of the plot. N'imat-i Haidarí had his moustache very unceremoniously
cut off, and was commanded to forfeit a pious garb with the crushing
remark: "It will be necessary for you to recommend yourself to some
holy man of the day, who, peradventure, may yet put you on the right
way." This man's brother, who had also offended, was forced to wear
a fool's cap and to ride on an ass with his head facing the animal's
tail, amid the none too complimentary remarks of the Baghdad people.</p>

<p>Although Jámí, in spite of the incident mentioned above, remained in
Baghdad four months, he never forgot the insult, and expressed himself
bitterly on the subject in some of his poetry.</p>

<p>We then find our poet continuing his journey to Mecca, and both on his
way to the holy city of Islam and upon his return therefrom, he met
with cordial receptions from the people, who came out to do him honour.
On one occasion, however, while Jámí stayed at Aleppo the Sultán of Rúm
sent a messenger with a present of five thousand pieces of gold if Jámí
would consent to visit Constantinople. The messenger came to Damascus
only to find that Jámí had recently vacated it. The poet, hearing of
the Sultán of Rúm's intentions, and wishing to avoid his munificence,
took his departure to Tabríz. At this town Hasan Beg, the Governor of
Kurdistan, made repeated overtures to try and persuade the poet to
reside in his capital. But Jámí, making the excuse that he wished to
visit his aged mother, journeyed to Khorasan. Fate, however, ordained
honours and showers of gold for the none too grateful or needy Jámí,
and at Khorasan he was again the recipient of many costly presents.</p>

<p>Jámí, probably wearied with the continual adulation which he had
everywhere received, now retired from public life. At this juncture
little is recorded of him, and here we must leave him with one anecdote
which will serve to show his ready wit: "You (<i>i.e.</i> God) so occupy my
whole thoughts and vision, that whatsoever comes into view from afar
appears to me to be You." "What," said a sharp contemporary, "if a
jackass were to come into view?" "It would appear to me to be <i>you</i>!"
was Jámí's prompt reply.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a id="II_THE_STORY_OF_SALAMAN_AND_ABSAL"></a>II. THE STORY OF "SALÁMÁN AND ABSÁL."</h4>


<p>In this beautiful little allegory, the meaning of which is so obvious
that Jámí need not have explained it in his Epilogue, we read of the
Shah of Yunan. He was a king ever wisely counselled by a sage who kept
the Tower of Wisdom, and might be therefore reasonably supposed to be a
fit and able personage to have about the king's person. However, this
sage was also a cynic.</p>

<p>One day, after the king had poured forth a very beautiful lament on
his childless marriage, and had concluded by remarking that a son was
"man's prime desire," the keeper of the Tower of Wisdom supplemented
his lord's remarks by describing woman as "A foolish, faithless thing,"
and marriage made miserable by "One little twist of temper." If the
sage succeeded in frightening the king with his tirade on earthly
marriage, he was certainly not successful in quelling the king's desire
for a son. Of course in allegories nothing is impossible, and we are
not at all surprised to find that the king's wish was fulfilled by
magic! The fond father named his son Salámán and chose Absál for his
nurse.</p>

<p>Absál seems to have been delighted with her charge:</p>

<p class="poet">
As soon as she had opened eyes on him,<br />
She closed those eyes to all the world beside.<br />
</p>

<p>By this we might well infer that Absál was a most estimable nurse.
It so happened, however, that her eyes remained closed to everything
else but her charge to such an alarming extent that when Salámán
was fourteen years old she revealed herself, with many subtle,
Zulaikha-like wiles, as his devoted lover.</p>

<p>After the young people had spent a joyous year together, the knowledge
of their attachment came to the ears of the king. That wise ruler
duly admonished his wayward son and suggested hunting in preference
to "dalliance unwise." The sage added his profound wisdom, as was his
wont. These admonitions only resulted in the lovers fleeing the city.
Across desert and sea they went until they came to a most wonderful
island, the island of all earthly delights.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Shah became aware of his son's "Soul-wasting
absence." The much troubled king looked into a mirror, "Reflecting all
the world," and saw the lovers on their beautiful island, "Looking
only in each other's eyes, and never finding any sorrow there." The
old king, remembering, perhaps, his early days, pitied them at first.
But human pity is usually short-lived. Day after day seeing the same
lovelorn objects in the magic mirror, he grew very angry and decided
to make the lovers' embraces impossible in future. The king succeeded
in casting a spell and also in revealing his face to his son, which
so pricked the young man's conscience that he and Absál left their
beautiful island and returned to their city. But here Salámán was torn
with conflicting thoughts about his beloved Absál. Memories of the
island garden came back to him again. In this melancholy state of mind
the lovers again journeyed forth into the desert, this time to cut down
branches and burn themselves to death. "Hand in hand they sprang into
the fire." While one little hand slipped away from its hold and one
fair body fell among the flames, Salámán remained unscathed.</p>

<p>It was after this sad scene that the sage explained the nature of
Celestial Love, and revealed to Salámán's weary eyes the beautiful
goddess, Zuhrah. Little by little Salámán came to regard his old
earthly love as "The bondage of Absál," a thing merely of the senses,
whereas this new Knowledge, this Love, belonged to the "Harvest of
Eternity." And so this beautiful little poem, to put it as briefly as
possible, tells of the love that binds and fetters and is corruptible,
and of that other Love that is Incorruptible.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a id="III_THE_TEACHING_OF_THE_LAWAIH"></a>III. THE TEACHING OF THE "LAWÁ'IH."</h4>


<p>The <i>Lawá'ih</i>, or "Flashes of Light," is a theological treatise based
on Súfíism, and is a book of immense importance to the student of
Mysticism. It will afford him a very interesting and striking parallel
to Neo-Platonism (Plotinus in particular), and also to some of the
Buddhistic teachings. As I have treated the subject of Súfíism, or
Persian Mysticism, elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I need add but few words to this
particular volume of Súfí lore.</p>

<p>The keynote to the <i>Lawá'ih</i> is to be found in Jámí's preface. He
describes the work as "Explanatory of the intuitions and verities
displayed on the pages of the hearts and minds of men of insight and
divine knowledge." After a request to his readers to refrain from
"cavilling and animadversion," he continues, this time in verse:</p>

<p class="poet">
Believe me, I am naught&mdash;yea, less than naught.<br />
By naught and less than naught what can be taught?<br />
<br />
I tell the mysteries of truth, but know<br />
Naught save the telling to this task I brought.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">* * * * * * * * * * * * * *</span><br />
With men of light I sought these pearls to string,<br />
The drift of mystics' sayings forth to bring.<br />
</p>

<p>The <i>Lawá'ih</i>, expounds some very beautiful and very ennobling truths.
In "Flash II." Jámí pleads for the love of One and the abandonment of
all little earthly loves that distract the attention of the lover for
his Beloved&mdash;precisely the same theme as that expressed in <i>Salámán
and Absál</i>. The poet loudly condemns "Hell-born vanity" and the
accumulation of worldly wisdom, even all learning except "The lore of
God." It would be a strange theme for a poet to so persistently choose
were not Jámí a mystic. With the "Inner light" of the true mystic he
sets aside the things of the world as being unsatisfactory. He does
not, however, merely pull down the fading, ever vanishing vanities of
the world, but with the strong clear voice of the poet-prophet, he
sings:</p>

<p class="poet">
The fleeting phantoms you admire to-day<br />
Will soon at Heaven's behest be swept away.<br />
O give your heart to Him who never fails,<br />
Who, ever with you, and will ever stay.<br />
</p>

<p>Jámí advocates, as others have done before him, the destruction of self
in order to gain knowledge of Very Being, "Until He mingles Himself
with thy soul, and thine own individual existence passes out of thy
sight." The poet also discusses the question of matter being <i>maya</i>&mdash;
I delusion, the ceaseless round of "Accidents," the I ever coming and
vanishing media for the revelations of the Beloved.</p>

<p>The <i>Lawá'ih</i> should be studied in conjunction with Mahmud Shabistari's
<i>Gulshan-i-Raz</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or "The Mystic Rose Garden." The main teaching of
both these books is that the indwelling of God I in the soul can only
take place when that soul realises that self is a delusion, that things
of this I world are but phantom-pictures coming and going, as it were,
upon the surface of a mirror:</p>

<p class="poet">
Go, sweep out the chamber of your heart,<br />
Make it ready to be the dwelling-place of the Beloved.<br />
When you depart out, He will enter in,<br />
In you, void of <i>yourself</i>, will He display His beauty.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br />
</p>

<p>The phenomenal world to the Súfí was nothing more than an
ever-recurring process of genesis and end: union with the Divine,
annihilation of that process. The <i>Lawá'ih</i> is deeply spiritual
throughout, and full of an almost pathetic pity for those who delight
in worldly pleasures and find no joy in contemplating Union with the
Beloved.</p>

<p>Jámí, after having spent considerable care on his <i>Lawá'ih</i>, and after
his reader has made a strenuous effort to catch a momentary glimpse of
his visionary meaning, concludes:</p>

<p class="poet">
Jámí, leave polishing of phrases, cease<br />
Writing and chanting fables, hold thy peace;<br />
Dream not that "Truth" can be revealed by words:<br />
From this fond dream, O dreamer, find release!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">* * * * * * * * * * * * * *</span><br />
How long wilt thou keep clanging like a bell?<br />
Thou'lt never come to hold the pearl of "Truth"<br />
Till thou art made all ear, as is the shell.

<p>And here we see the great mystical poet sitting, like a little child
listening to a tale that is told, quelled into reverential silence by
the greatness of the theme. It is in silence, in the quiet places of
our hearts, rather than on the housetops of much controversy, that we
can hear the sweet call of the Beloved and forget the clanging of the
world in the Great Peace which He alone can give.</p>

<h4><a id="IV_THE_STORY_OF_YUSUF_AND_ZULAIKHA"></a>IV. THE STORY OF YÚSUF AND ZULAIKHA.</h4>

<p><i>Yúsuf and Zulaikha</i>, like <i>Salámán and Absál,</i> belongs to the series
of poems known as the <i>Haft Aurang</i>. Jámí heralds his poem with a good
deal of laudacious singing on the Prophet, Beauty, Love, and concludes
by remarking that the loves of Majnún and Laila "have had their day,"
and makes this excuse for weaving another love poem on another theme.
But this scheme was scarcely original, Firdawsí and Ansari having
previously composed poems on a similar subject. However, the tongue of
the critic is surely silenced by these humble lines:</p>

<p class="poet">
If here and there a slip or fault you see,<br />
May he not lay the blame of all on me.<br />
May he correct my errors, or befriend<br />
With generous silence faults he cannot mend.<br />
</p>

<p>If the work be regarded as a love poem, without its mystical
interpretation, Yúsuf may well be regarded as a cold, statuesque young
man of the St. Anthony type, but cast in a more beautiful mould.
While we may equally well regard Zulaikha as a passionate young lady
sadly lacking in worldly wisdom. The coldness of Yúsuf would probably
irritate us were we not frequently reminded of the way in which poor
Zulaikha plagues him with her too constant attentions. Neither strike
us as being very ordinary human people for precisely reverse reasons.
There are occasions, however, when Zulaikha awakens our sympathy. It is
touching to note that when she finds her own love slighted she should
send other women to try their fortune with him, intending, should they
succeed, to subtly take their place by strategy of some kind. Again,
in the splendid Palace of Pleasure, painted all over, floor and wall
and ceiling, with love-entwined figures of Yúsuf and Zulaikha, there is
an idol&mdash;"A golden idol with jewelled eyes," representing this fatuous
woman's love. The idol is placed behind a curtain, and on Yúsuf asking
the reason, Zulaikha replies:</p>

<p class="poet">
If I swerve from religion I would not be<br />
Where the angry eyes of my god may see.<br />
</p>

<p>Then we watch the honeyed sweetness of Zulaikha's passion burst forth
into bitter hate and shameless lying. We see the proud, chaste Yúsuf
cast into prison on false pretences and quite melodramatically freed
by the marvellous utterance of a babe at its mother's breast.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But Zulaikha finds the gossip of Memphis hard to be borne&mdash;the
insinuations, the sneers, the cruel reproaches for the unrequited and
ill-fated love of hers. Moreover, Zulaikha, like the women of Austria
at the beginning of the eighteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> had a husband as well
as a lover, Potiphar, Grand Vizier of Egypt. These two concocted a
scandalous story, which was easily set going and as easily believed by
the common people. It resulted in Yúsuf being again sent to prison. At
this point of the poem we are once more reminded of the Bible story of
Joseph, for Jámí also mentions the interpretation of Pharaoh's dream,
the release of the interpreter, and the unlimited power as the king's
right hand that followed.</p>

<p>So we watch Yúsuf rise from slave to be the king's chief adviser, and
in consequence the fall of the Grand Vizier and Zulaikha. The success
of Yúsuf awakens little admiration. He is so far from being human that
we should not have been very surprised if he had eaten one of the
Pyramids.</p>

<p>But Zulaikha's condition is to be pitied. She is now a widow. Her
jewels are gone, her dress is in rags, there are wrinkles in her once
beautiful face, and her back is bent. But more than all these trials is
the loss of her eyesight. We see her crouching in the road, listening
eagerly for the sound of the coming of the proud Yúsuf on his wonderful
steed,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> happy to feel the dust of his passing procession. There is a
note of real pathos in this scene. We see for the first time, perhaps,
that Zulaikha's passion is changing into a fairer, nobler thing.
Sometimes the boys who preceded Yúsuf would shout to her as she sat by
her cottage of reeds, "Yúsuf is nigh!" But Zulaikha's heart, sore and
hungry and yearning, knew better than they the approach of her lord.
The eyes that had seen the Palace of Pleasure saw more now that they
were blind! And yet the old passion had not quite burnt itself out. We
see the bent form crouching on the ground, feeling the statue of her
Yúsuf with her thin, trembling fingers, and piteously praying for some
recognition.</p>

<p>The sound of Yúsuf's steed is heard in the distance, and a great shout
rends the air: "Make room! Make room!" Zulaikha again crouches in the
roadway. How long has she "made room" for the selfish and unfeeling
ambitions of a man who was once her pampered slave! It is then, for the
first time, that the soul of Zulaikha asserts itself and the mysticism
of the poem becomes strongly evident. The material spell of a fleshly
love is broken at last. In humility and absolute resignation Zulaikha
shatters her once dear idol, destroys a sordid and hopeless dream. Her
red rose of passion is turned into a white one, as she fervently cries:</p>

<p class="poet">
O God, who lovest the humble, Thou<br />
To whom idols, their makers, their servants bow;<br />
'Tis to the light which Thy splendour lends<br />
To the idol's face that its worshipper bends.<br />
</p>

<p>Still more triumphant are her words:</p>

<p class="poet">
Glory to God! to a monarch's state<br />
He has cast the king from his glory down,<br />
And set on the head of a servant his crown.<br />
</p>

<p>These words sufficiently interest Yúsuf to ask, "Who is this
bedeswoman?" and eventually to win an interview for the poor "Unpitied,
forgotten, disgraced woman." Yúsuf does not proceed to moralise; but he
does not dispense with frigid formalities beyond calling her Zulaikha
and offering, in a studied kind of way, to do anything for her that she
may desire. Zulaikha asks for beauty, youth, and the power to win his
love. Yúsuf grants her first two wishes, and the decrepit old woman
is changed into the ravishingly beautiful Zulaikha of eighteen. But
Yúsuf,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> cold even now, in silence turns in prayer to Heaven, and
takes Gabriel's word rather than his own conviction that he is doing
well to marry her at last.</p>

<p>Here the late Mr. Ralph Griffith's translation of <i>Yúsuf and Zulaikha</i>
ends, and the curious and farseeing might be pardoned for conjecturing
an unhappy marriage under these remarkably one-sided circumstances.
But in the original the poem does not end here. For the advantage of
optimistic believers in marriage, I may add that these two people
had an almost unending honeymoon. Remarkable as it may appear,
Zulaikha actually became religious, for which altogether wonderful
and unexpected event the now kindly Yúsuf built her a most beautiful
House of Prayer. The canto entitled "The Longed-for Death" is a little
disconcerting, perhaps, but we may reasonably suppose that Yúsuf became
religious too, and was not in any way uncomplimentary to his beautiful
bride. His death was well arranged, and he was shortly joined by the
soul of Zulaikha.</p>

<p>This, then, is &amp; brief sketch of <i>Yúsuf and Zulaikha</i>. Like <i>Salámán
and Absál</i> it is intended to reveal the beauty of the Beloved; that
He can be only approached after much purification, when the physical
form ceases to blind the soul's outlook, and only when we realise that
passion is an idol that must be broken, and Love the pure Light that
shines alone from Him.</p>

<h4><a id="V_THE_BAHARISTAN_OR_ABODE_OF_SPRING"></a>V. THE "BAHÁRISTÁN," OR "ABODE OF SPRING"</h4>


<p>The <i>Baháristán</i>, or "Abode of Spring," is admitted by Jámí to be
an imitation of Sa'di's <i>Gulistán</i>, or "Rose Garden." The idea of
arranging a book of verse and prose into a series of "Gardens" was
a very beautiful one. Two other books compiled on similar lines are
Sa'di's <i>Bústán</i>, or "Orchard," and the <i>Nigaristán</i>, or "Picture
Gallery," by Mu'in-uddin Jawini, which appeared in 1334 A.D. Sir
Edwin Arnold's <i>With Sa'di in a Garden</i> gives the Westerner some
idea of the beauty of Eastern gardens, and this particular garden is
rendered all the more delectable because it holds a greater beauty
than the loveliest garden, the Taj Mahal itself. Sir Edwin transfers
Persian poetry to an Indian garden, which is not very dissimilar to
the beautiful gardens of Shiraz. Professor A. V. Williams Jackson<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
describes the <i>Bagh-i-Takht</i>, "Garden of the Throne," thus: "Terrace
rises above terrace, and fountain, channel, and stream pour their
waters in cascades over slabs of marble into reservoirs faced with
stone&mdash;the walks bordered with cypress and orange trees." It would be
interesting to know if the terraces in any way corresponded with the
idea of naming and numbering the "Gardens" in Jámí's <i>Baháristán.</i> A
beautiful mosque, a bower of roses, running water; might not these
things alone have suggested to the poet's mind "The pavilion of
Excellency, Love, and Laughter?"</p>

<p>The <i>Baháristán</i> has a distinct interest apart from its literary merit.
It appears to have been written by Jámí for the instruction of his
"darling and beloved son Ziá-uddin-Yúsuf." The poet-father goes on to
say, "That young boys and inexperienced youths become very disheartened
and unhappy when they receive instruction in idiomatic expressions
they are not accustomed to." Although Jámí allowed his son to read the
<i>Gulistán</i>, he evidently thought the last word had not yet been written
in the interests of instructing the young, and thus conceived the idea
of writing the <i>Baháristán</i>.</p>

<p>One is so apt to see printed requests in the public gardens of England
that it seems a little ironical to come across the following in the
literary "Gardens" of Jámí: "It is requested that the promenaders
in these gardens&mdash;which contain no thorns to give offence, nor
rubbish displayed for interested purposes,&mdash;walking through them with
sympathetic steps and looking at them carefully, will bestow their good
wishes, and rejoice with praise the gardener who has spent much trouble
and great exertions in planning and cultivating these gardens." In
regard to the statement that the <i>Gardens</i> "contain no Thorns to give
offence," I, for one, must beg to differ. One ugly weed there is which
the gardener would have done well to destroy in his otherwise very
beautiful garden.</p>

<p>The <i>Baháristán</i> is divided into eight "Gardens." The <i>First</i> deals
with the sayings and doings of the saintly, wise, and those "who occupy
the chief seats in the pavilion of Excellency." The <i>Second</i> with
philosophical subtleties. The <i>Third</i> with Justice, Equity, Government,
and Administration, and in general "to show the wisdom of Sultáns." The
<i>Fourth</i> with Liberality and Generosity. The <i>Fifth</i> with Love. The
<i>Sixth</i> with "Blowing of the zephyrs of wit, and the breezes of jocular
sallies, which cause the buds of the lips to laugh and the flowers of
the hearts; to bloom." The <i>Seventh</i> with a selection from the work of
Persian poets. The <i>Eighth</i>, and last, with animal stories.</p>

O Thou, whose memory quickens lovers' souls,<br />
Whose fount of joy renews the lover's tongue,<br />
Thy shadow falls across the world, and they<br />
Bow down to it; and of the rich in beauty<br />
Thou art the riches that make lovers mad.<br />
Not till Thy secret beauty through the cheek<br />
Of Laila smite does she inflame Majnún,<br />
And not till Thou have sugar'd Shírín's lip<br />
The hearts of those two lovers fill with blood.<br />
For lov'd and lover are not but by Thee,<br />
Nor beauty; mortal beauty but the veil<br />
Thy heavenly hides behind, and from itself<br />
Feeds, and our hearts yearn after as a bride<br />
That glances past us veil'd&mdash;but even so<br />
As none the beauty from the veil may know.<br />
How long wilt Thou continue thus the world<br />
To cozen with the phantom of a veil<br />
From which Thou only peepest?&mdash;Time it is<br />
To unfold Thy perfect beauty. I would be<br />
Thy lover, and Thine only&mdash;I, mine eyes<br />

Yea, in the revelation of Thyself<br />
Self-lost, and conscience-quit of good and evil.<br />

Opening and shutting which her day's delight,<br />
To gaze upon his heart-inflaming cheek&mdash;<br />
Upon the darling whom, could she, she would<br />
Have cradled as the baby of her eye.<br />
In rose and musk she wash'd him&mdash;to his lips<br />
Press'd the pure sugar from the honeycomb;<br />

She made, and having laid him in, his bed,<br />
Burn'd all night like a taper o'er his head.<br />

Then still as morning came, and as he grew,<br />
She dressed him like a little idol up;<br />
On with his robe&mdash;with fresh collyrium dew<br />

Roses; or the lofty cypress,<br />

Now from her hair would twine a musky chain,<br />
To bind his heart&mdash;now twist it into curls<br />
Nestling innumerable temptations;<br />
Doubled the darkness of her eyes with surma<br />
To make him lose his way, and over them<br />
Adorn'd the bows that were to shoot him then;<br />
Fresh rose, and then a grain of musk lay there,<br />
The bird of the beloved heart to snare.<br />
Now to the rose-leaf of her cheek would add,<br />
Now with a laugh would break the ruby seal<br />
That, lockt up pearl; or busied in the room<br />
Would smite her hand, perhaps&mdash;on that pretence<br />
To lift and show the silver in her sleeve;<br />
Or hastily rising, dash her golden anklets<br />
To draw the crowned head under her feet.<br />
Thus by innumerable bridal wiles<br />
She went about soliciting his eyes,<br />
Which she would scarce let lose her for a moment;<br />
For well she knew that mainly by the eye<br />
Love makes his sign, and by no other road<br />

And of the running time she watch'd an hour<br />
To creep into the mansion of her moon<br />
And satiate her soul upon his lips.<br />
And the hour came; she stole into his chamber&mdash;<br />
Ran up to him, Life's offer in her hand&mdash;<br />
And, falling like a shadow at his feet,<br />
She laid her face beneath. Salámán then<br />
With all the courtesies of princely grace<br />
Put forth his hand&mdash;he rais'd her in his arms&mdash;<br />
He held her trembling there&mdash;and from that fount<br />
Drew first desire; then deeper from her lips,<br />
That, yielding, mutually drew from his<br />
A wine that ever drawn from never fail'd.<br />
So through the day&mdash;so through another still.<br />
The day became a seventh&mdash;the seventh a moon&mdash;<br />
The moon a year&mdash;while they rejoiced together,<br />
Thinking their pleasure never was to end.<br />
But rolling Heaven whisper'd from his ambush,<br />
"So in my license is it not set down.<br />
Ah for the sweet societies I make<br />
At morning and before the nightfall break!<br />

<br />
O thou whose presence so long sooth'd my soul,<br />
Now burnt with thy remembrance! O so long<br />
The light that fed these eyes now dark with tears!<br />
O long, long home of love now lost for ever!<br />
We were together&mdash;that was all enough&mdash;<br />
We two rejoicing in each other's eyes,<br />
Infinitely rejoicing&mdash;all the world<br />
Nothing to us, nor we to all the world:<br />
No road to reach us, nor an eye to watch&mdash;<br />
All day we whisper'd in each other's ears,<br />
All night we slept in one another's arms&mdash;<br />
All seem'd to our desire, as if the hand<br />
Of unjust Fortune were for once too short.<br />
O would to God that when I lit the pyre<br />
The flame had left thee living and me dead,<br />
Not living worse than dead, depriv'd of thee!<br />
O were I but with thee! at any cost<br />
Stript of this terrible self-solitude!<br />
O but with thee annihilation&mdash;lost,<br />
Or in eternal intercourse renew'd!<br />

To-morrow's seed-field, ere that come to bear<br />
Sow with the harvest of eternity.<br />

<br />
O God, deliver us from preoccupation with
worldly vanities, and show us the nature of things
"as they really are." Remove from our eyes
the veil of ignorance, and show us things as they
really are. Show not to us non-existence as
existent, nor cast the veil of non-existence over
the beauty of existence. Make this phenomenal
world the mirror to reflect the manifestations of
thy beauty, and not a veil to separate and repel
us from Thee. Cause these unreal phenomena of
the universe to be for us the sources of knowledge
and insight, and not the cause of ignorance and
blindness. Our alienation and severance from
Thy beauty all proceed from ourselves. Deliver
us from ourselves, and accord to us intimate
knowledge of Thee.</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THE ABSOLUTE BEAUTY"</span><br />
<br />
The Absolute Beauty is the Divine Majesty endued
with [the attributes of] power and bounty.
Every beauty and perfection manifested in the
theatre of the various grades of beings is a ray of
His perfect beauty reflected therein. It is from
these rays that exalted souls have received their
impress of beauty and their quality of perfection.
Whosoever is wise derives his wisdom from Divine
wisdom.</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"MY LOVE STOOD BY ME AT THE DAWN OF DAY"</span><br />
<br />
My love stood by me at the dawn of day,<br />
And said, "To grief you make my heart a prey<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whilst I am casting looks of love at you,</span><br />
Have you no shame to turn your eyes away?"<br />
<br />
All my life long I tread love's path of pain,<br />
If peradventure "Union" I may gain.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Better to catch one moment's glimpse of Thee</span><br />
Than earthly beauties' love through life retain.<br />

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GOD THE ONLY LOVE ETERNAL</span>
Yesterday this universe neither existed nor
appeared to exist, while to-day it appears to exist
but has no real existence: it is a mere semblance,
and to-morrow nothing thereof will be seen.
What does it profit thee to allow thyself to be
guided by vain passions and desires? Why dost
thou place reliance on these transitory objects
that glitter with false lustre? Turn thy heart
away from all of them, and firmly attach it to
God. Break loose from all these, and cleave
closely to Him. It is only He who always has
been and always will continue to be. The countenance
of His eternity is never scarred by the thorn
of contingency.</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FINITE AND INFINITE BEAUTY</span><br />
<br />
The Loved One's rose-parterre I went to see,<br />
That beauty's Torch espied me, and, quoth He,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I am the tree; these flowers My offshoots are.</span><br />
Let not these offshoots hide from thee the tree."<br />
<br />
What profit rosy cheeks, forms full of grace,<br />
And ringlets clustering round a lovely face?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Beauty Absolute beams all around,</span><br />
Why linger finite beauties to embrace?<br />
</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HOW TO OBTAIN UNION WITH THE DIVINE</span><br />
<br />
In like manner, as it behoves thee to maintain
the said relation continuously, so it is of the first
importance to develop one quality thereof by
detaching thyself from mundane relations and
by emancipating thyself from attention to
contingent forms; and this is possible only
through hard striving and earnest endeavour to
expel vain thoughts and imaginations from thy
mind. The more these thoughts are cast out and
these suggestions checked, the stronger and closer
this relation becomes. It is, then, necessary
to use every endeavour to force these thoughts to
encamp outside the enclosure of thy breast, and
that the "Truth" most glorious may cast His
beams into thy heart, and deliver thee from thyself,
and save thee from the trouble of entertaining His
rivals in thy heart. Then there will abide with-thee
neither consciousness of thyself, nor even
consciousness of such absence of consciousness&mdash;nay,
there will abide nothing save the One God
alone.</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRUTH</span><br />
<br />
In the fair idols, goal of ardent youth,<br />
And in all cynosures lies hid the "Truth";<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What, seen as relative, appears the world,</span><br />
Viewed in its essence is the very "Truth."<br />
<br />
When in His partial modes Truth shone out plain,<br />
Straightway appeared this world of loss and gain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were it and all who dwell there gathered back</span><br />
Into the Whole, the "Truth" would still remain.<br />

And fashions such another in its place.<br />
<br />
All gifts soever unto God are due,<br />
Yet special gifts from special "Names" ensue;<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE GOD BEHIND THE VEIL</span><br />
<br />
"O fairest rose, with rosebud mouth," I sighed,<br />
"Why, like coquettes, thy face for ever hide?"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He smiled, "Unlike the beauties of the earth,</span><br />
Even when veiled I still may be described."<br />
<br />
Thy face uncovered would be all too bright,<br />
Without a veil none could endure the sight;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What eye is strong enough to gaze upon</span><br />
The dazzling splendour of the fount of light?<br />
<br />
When the sun's banner blazes in the sky,<br />
Its light gives pain by its intensity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when 'tis tempered by a veil of cloud</span><br />
That light is soft and pleasant to the eye.<br />

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE DIVINE SELF-SUFFICIENCY</span><br />
<br />
Absolute self-sufficiency is a quality involved
in Divine Perfection. It signifies this, that in
a general and universal manner all the modes,
states, and aspects of the One Real Being, with all
their adherent properties and qualities, in all
their presentations, past, present, or future,
manifested in all grades of substances, divine and
mundane, are present and realised in the secret
thought of that Divine Being, in such wise that
the sum of them all is contained in His Unity.
From this point of view He is independent of all
other existences; as it is said, "God most glorious
can do without the world."</p>

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OUR NEED OF THE BELOVED</span><br />
<br />
O Thou whose sacred precincts none may see,<br />
Unseen Thou makest all things seen to be;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou and we are not separate, yet still</span><br />
Thou hast no need of us, but we of Thee.<br />
<br />
None by endeavour can behold Thy face,<br />
Or access gain without prevenient grace;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For every man some substitute is found,</span><br />
Thou hast no peer, and none can take Thy place.<br />
<br />
Of accident or substance Thou hast nought,<br />
Without constraint of cause Thy grace is wrought;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thou canst replace what's lost, but if Thou'rt lost,</span><br />
In vain a substitute for Thee is sought.<br />
<br />
In me Thy beauty love and longing wrought;<br />
Did I not seek Thee, how wouldst Thou be sought?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My love is as a mirror in the which</span><br />
Thy beauty into evidence is brought.<br />
<br />
O Lord, none but Thyself can fathom Thee,<br />
Yet every mosque and church doth harbour Thee;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know the seekers and what 'tis they seek&mdash;</span><br />
Seekers and sought are all comprised in Thee.<br />
</p>



<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE UNIVERSE A NUMBER OF "ACCIDENTS"</span><br />
<br />
The universe, together with its parts, is nothing
but a number of accidents, ever changing and
being renewed at every breath, and linked together
in a single substance, and at each instant
disappearing and being replaced by a similar set.
In consequence of this rapid succession, the
spectator is deceived into the belief that the
universe is a permanent existence.</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE HIDDEN TRUTH</span><br />
<br />
The ocean does not shrink or vaster grow,<br />
Though the waves ever ebb and ever flow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The being of the world's a wave: it lasts</span><br />
One moment, and the next it has to go.<br />
<br />
In the world, men of insight may discern<br />
A stream whose currents swirl and surge and churn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And from the force that works within the stream</span><br />
The hidden working of the "Truth" may learn.<br />
</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THE GREAT IDEALIST"</span><br />

The great Idealist who looms behind.<br />
</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SEA OF BEING</span><br />
<br />
Being's a sea in constant billows rolled,<br />
'Tis but these billows that we men behold;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sped from within, they rest upon the sea,</span><br />
And like a veil its actual form enfold.<br />
<br />
Being's the essence of the Lord of all,<br />
All things exist in Him and He in all;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This is the meaning of the Gnostic phrase,</span><br />
"All things are comprehended in the All."<br />
</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE REVELATION OF TRUTH</span><br />
<br />
The Majesty of the "Truth" most glorious is
revealed in two manners&mdash;the first the inward,
subjective revelation, which the Súfís name
"Most Holy Emanation"; it consists in the
self-manifestation of the "Truth" to His own
consciousness from all eternity under the forms
of substances, their characteristics and capacities.
The second revelation is the outward objective
manifestation, which is called "Holy Emanation";
it consists in the manifestation of the
"Truth," with the impress of the properties and
marks of the same substances. This second
revelation ranks after the first; it is the theatre
wherein are manifested to sight the perfections
which in the first revelation were contained potentially
in the characteristics and capacities of
the substances.</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"'TIS HE WHO LIVES WITHIN OUR FORMS"</span><br />
<br />
Both power and being are denied to us,<br />
The lack of both is what's ordained for us;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But since 'tis He who lives within our forms,</span><br />
Both power and action are ascribed to us.<br />
<br />
Your "self" is non-existent, knowing one!<br />
Deem not your actions by yourself are done;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make no wry faces at this wholesome truth&mdash;</span><br />
"Build the wall ere the fresco is begun."<br />
<br />
Why vaunt thy "self" before those jealous eyes?<br />
Why seek to deal in this false merchandise?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why feign to be existent of thyself?</span><br />
Down with these vain conceits and foolish lies!<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MIRROR AND FACE</span><br />
<br />
They say, "How strange! This peerless beauty's face<br />
Within the mirror's heart now holds a place!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The marvel's not the face, the marvel is</span><br />
That it should be at once mirror and face.<br />
<br />
All mirrors in the universe I ween<br />
Display Thy image with its radiant sheen&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nay, in them all, so vast Thy effluent grace,</span><br />
'Tis Thyself, not Thine image, that is seen.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE COMING OF THE BELOVED</span><br />
<br />
In solitude, where Being signless dwelt,<br />
And all the universe still dormant lay<br />
Concealed in selflessness, One Being was<br />
Exempt from "I" or "Thou"-ness, and apart<br />
From all duality; Beauty Supreme,<br />
Unmanifest, except unto Itself<br />
By Its own lights yet fraught with power to charm<br />
The souls of all; concealed in the Unseen,<br />
An Essence pure, unstained by aught of ill.<br />
No mirror to reflect Its loveliness,<br />
Nor comb to touch Its locks; the morning breeze<br />
Ne'er stirred Its tresses; no collyrium<br />
Lent lustre to Its eyes; no rosy cheeks<br />
O'ershadowed by dark curls like hyacinth<br />
Nor peach-like down were there; no dusky mole<br />
Adorned Its face; no eye had yet beheld<br />
Its image. To Itself it sang of Love<br />
In wordless measures. By Itself it cast<br />
The die of Love. But Beauty cannot brook<br />
Concealment and the veil, nor patient rest<br />
Unseen and unadmired; 'twill burst all bonds,<br />
And from Its prison-casement to the world<br />
Reveal Itself. See where the tulip grows<br />
In upland meadows, how in balmy spring<br />
It decks itself; and how amidst its thorns<br />
The wild rose rends its garment, and reveals<br />
Its loveliness. Thou too, when some rare thought,<br />
Or beauteous image, or deep mystery<br />
Flashes across thy soul, canst not endure<br />
To let it pass, but holdst it, that perchance<br />
In speech or writing thou mayst send it forth<br />
To charm the world. Whatever beauty dwells,<br />
Such is its nature, and its heritage<br />
From Everlasting Beauty, which emerged<br />
From realms of purity to shine upon<br />
The worlds, and all the souls which dwell therein.<br />
One gleam fell from It on the universe<br />
And on the angels, and this single ray<br />
Dazzled the angels, till their senses whirled<br />
Like the revolving sky. In diverse forms<br />
Each mirror showed it forth, and everywhere<br />
Its praise was chanted in new harmonies.<br />
The cherubim, enraptured, sought for songs<br />
Of praise. The spirits who explore the depths<br />
Of boundless seas, wherein the heavens swim<br />
Like some small boat, cried with one mighty voice,<br />
"Praise to the Lord of all the universe!"<br />

A flood of radiance on the world below.<br />
See them pursuing through the night and day,<br />
True to their purpose, their triumphant way.<br />
Each, like a player's ball obedient, still<br />
Is moved and guided by superior will.<br />
One eastward from the west its journey bends,<br />
The other's ship to western waves descends.<br />
Each in due progress with alternate sway<br />
Lights the still night or cheers the busy day.<br />
One writes fair lines that promise golden joys:<br />
One with sad aspect bonds of bliss destroys.<br />
All, joying in their might, their task renew,<br />
And with untiring haste their course pursue.<br />
Onward for ever to the goal they press<br />
With feet and loins that know not weariness.<br />

The ways of love and then to me return."<br />
Drink deep of earthly love, that so thy lip<br />

Came with her tribute to beauty the fawn;<br />

Thou callest the waist of that body most fair<br />
By the musky spots on thy cheek's pure rose,<br />
By the smile of thy lips when those buds unclose,<br />
By my longing tears, by the sigh and groan<br />
That rend my heart as I pine alone;<br />
By thine absence, a mountain too heavy to bear,<br />
By my thousand fetters of grief and care;<br />
By the sovereign sway of my passion, by<br />
My carelessness whether I live or die;<br />
Pity me, pity my lovelorn grief:<br />
Loosen my fetters and grant relief:<br />
An age has scorched me since over my soul<br />
The soft sweet air of thy garden stole.<br />
Be the balm of my wounds for a little; shed<br />
Sweet scent on the heart where the flowers are dead<br />
I hunger for thee till my whole frame is weak:<br />
O give me the food for my soul which I seek."<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE HORSE OF YÚSUF</span><br />
<br />
In his stalls had Yúsuf a fairy steed,<br />
A courser through space of no earthly breed;<br />
Swift as the heavens, and black and white<br />
With a thousand patches of day and night;<br />
Now a jetty spot, now a starry blaze,<br />
Like Time with succession of nights and days.<br />
With his tail the heavenly Virgo's hair,<br />
With his hoof the moon, was afraid to compare.<br />
Each foot with a golden new moon was shod,<br />
And the stars of its nails struck the earth as he trod.<br />
When his hoof smote sharp on the rugged flint<br />
A planet flashed forth from the new moon's dint;<br />
And a new moon rose in the sky when a shoe<br />
From the galloping foot of the courser flew.<br />
Like an arrow shot through its side in the chase.<br />
He outstripped the game in the deadly race.<br />
At a single bound he would spring, unpressed,<br />
With the lightning's speed from the east to the west.<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE FREEING OF ZULAIKHA'S SOUL</span><br />
<br />
"O thou who hast broken mine honour's urn,<br />
Thou stone of offence wheresoever I turn,<br />
I should smite&mdash;for thy falsehood has ruined my rest&mdash;<br />
With the stone thou art made of, the heart in my breast.<br />
The way of misfortune too surely I trod<br />
When I bowed down before thee and made thee my god;<br />
When I looked up to thee with wet eyes in my woe,<br />
I renounced all the bliss which both worlds can bestow.<br />
From thy stony dominion my soul will I free,<br />
And thus shatter the gem of thy power and thee."<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">BREAKING THE IDOL</span><br />
<br />
With a hard flint stone, like the Friend,<a name="FNanchor_2_14" id="FNanchor_2_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_14" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as she spoke,<br />
In a thousand pieces the image she broke.<br />
Riven and shattered the idol fell,<br />
And with her from that moment shall all be well.<br />
She made her ablution, 'mid penitent sighs,<br />
With the blood of her heart and the tears of her eyes.<br />
She bent down her head to the dust; with a moan<br />
She made supplication to God's pure throne:&mdash;<br />
"O God, who lovest the humble, Thou<br />
To whom idols, their makers, their servants bow;<br />
'Tis to the light which Thy splendour lends<br />
To the idol's face that its worshipper bends.<br />
Thy love the heart of the sculptor stirs,<br />
And the idol is graven for worshippers.<br />
They bow them down to the image, and think<br />
That they worship Thee as before it they sink.<br />
To myself, O Lord, I have done this wrong,<br />
If mine eyes to an idol have turned so long.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">* * * * * * * * * * * * * *</span><br />
Thou hast washed the dark stain of my sin away;<br />
Now restore the lost blessing for which I pray.<br />
May I feel my heart free from the brand of its woes,<br />
And cull from the garden of Yúsuf a rose."<br />

<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">YÚSUF AND ZULAIKHA MEET AGAIN</span><br />
<br />
"Where is thy youth, and thy beauty, and pride?"<br />
"Gone, since I parted from thee!" she replied.<br />
"Where is the light of thine eye?" said he,<br />
"Drowned in blood-tears for the loss of thee."<br />
"Why is that cypress tree bowed and bent?"<br />
"By absence from thee and my long lament."<br />
"Where is thy pearl, and thy silver and gold,<br />
And the diadem bright on thy head of old?"<br />
"She who spoke of my loved one," she answered, "shed,<br />
In the praise of thy beauty, rare pearls on my head.<br />
In return for those jewels, a recompense meet,<br />
I scattered my jewels and gold at her feet.<br />
A crown of pure gold on her forehead I set,<br />
And the dust that she trod was my coronet.<br />
The stream of my treasure of gold ran dry;<br />
My heart is Love's storehouse, and I am I."<br />
</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ZULAIKHA'S YOUTH RETURNS</span><br />
<br />
The beauty returned which was ruined and dead,<br />
And her cheek gained the splendour which long I had fled.<br />
Again shone the waters which sad years had dried,<br />
And the rose-bed of youth bloomed again in its pride.<br />
The musk was restored and the camphor withdrawn,<br />
And the black night followed the grey of the dawn,<br />
The cypress rose stately and tall as of old:<br />
The pure silver was free from all wrinkle and fold.<br />
From each musky tress fled the traces of white:<br />
To the black narcissus came beauty and light.<br />
</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ZULAIKHA'S WISH</span><br />
<br />
"The one sole wish of my heart," she replied,<br />
"Is still to be near thee, to sit by thy side;<br />
To have thee by day in my happy sight,<br />
And to lay my cheek on thy foot at night;<br />
To lie in the shade of the cypress and sip<br />
The sugar that lies on thy ruby lip;<br />
To my wounded heart this soft balm to lay;<br />
For naught beyond this can I wish or pray.<br />
The streams of thy love will new life bestow<br />
On the dry thirsty field where its sweet waters flow."<br />

I heard her prayer when to thee she sued.<br />
At the sight of her labours, her prayers, and sighs,<br />
The waves of the sea of my pity rise.<br />
Her soul from the sword of despair I free,<br />
And here from My throne I betroth her to thee.'"<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">OCCUPATION ENNOBLED BY A GREAT MAN</span><br />
<br />
Alexander degraded one of his officials by removing
him from a high and employing him in a low
post. One day this man waited upon Alexander,
who asked him what he thought of his occupation,
and he replied: "May the life of my Lord be long!
A man is not ennobled by a great occupation,
but an occupation is ennobled by a great man.
In every post honesty, justice and equity are
needed." Alexander was pleased with this
opinion, and re-installed him in his former office.</p>

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE DOWNFALL OF THE MIGHTY</span><br />
<br />
The favourites of Sultáns are like people climbing
up a precipitous mountain, and falling off from
it in consequence of the quakes of anger and the
vicissitudes of time. There is no doubt that the
fall of those who are higher up is more disastrous
than the coming down of those who are in lower
positions.</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">JUSTICE AND VIRTUE</span><br />
<br />
A culprit having been brought before the Khalifa,
he ordered the punishment due to the
transgression to be administered. The prisoner said:
"O Commander of the Faithful, to take vengeance
for a crime is justice, but to pass it over
is virtue; and the magnanimity of the Prince of
the Faithful is more exalted, than that he should
disregard what is higher, and descend to what is
lower." The Khalifa, being pleased with his
argument, condoned his transgression.</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE WOMAN WHO WAS ASHAMED TO LOOK AT A MAN WHOM GOD HAD FORSAKEN</span><br />
<br />
A woman who belonged to the faction which had
risen in arms against Hajaj, having been brought
before him, he spoke to her, but she looked down,
and fixing her eyes upon the ground, neither
replied, nor glanced at him. One who was present
said: "O woman, the Amir is speaking, and
thou lookest away?" She replied: "I am
ashamed before God the Most High, to look on
a man, upon whom God the Most High does not
look."</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HOW ALEXANDER ACQUIRED HIS POWER</span><br />
<br />
Alexander having been asked by what means he
had attained such dominion, power, and glory

replied: "By conciliating foes till they turned
away from the path of enmity, and by strengthening
the alliances with friends till they became
firm in the bonds of amity."</p>

<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"THE VALUE OF A MAN"</span><br />
<br />
The price of a man consists not in silver and gold;<br />
The value of a man is his power and virtue.<br />
Many a slave has by acquiring virtue<br />
Attained much greater power than a gentleman,<br />
And many a gentleman has for want of virtue<br />
Become <i>inferior</i><a name="FNanchor_4_18" id="FNanchor_4_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_18" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to his own slave.<br />
</p>



<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LIBERALITY</span><br />
<br />
It is on record that 'Abdullah Ibn Ja'far (may
Allah be pleased with him!) intended one day to
travel, and approaching a date-grove where he
had seen some persons, he alighted. The guardian
of the trees happened to be a black slave, to
whom two loaves of bread had just been sent
from the house; and as a dog stood near him,
he threw one of the loaves to it, which having
been devoured by the animal, he gave away also
the other, and the dog likewise consumed it.
Then 'Abdullah (may Allah be pleased with him!)
asked what his daily allowance was. The slave
replied: "What thou hast seen." "Then why
hast thou not kept it for thyself?" "The dog
is a stranger here; I thought he had come from a
long distance and was hungry, wherefore I did not
mean to leave him in that condition." "Then
what wilt thou eat to-day?" "I shall fast."
Then 'Abdullah said to himself: "Everybody
is blaming me for my liberality, and this slave
is more liberal than myself." Then he purchased
both the slave and the date-grove, presenting
him with the latter, and emancipating him.</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">"LEARN THOU BRAVERY!"</span><br />
<br />
O brave man, learn thou bravery!<br />
From men of the world learn manliness.<br />
Preserve thy heart from the remorse of remorse-seekers;<br />
Preserve thy tongue from the blame of evil-speakers.<br />
Requite with good him who did thee evil,<br />
Because by that evil he injured his own prosperity.<br />
If thou makest beneficence thy rule<br />
The good thou doest will return only to thee.<br />
</p>



<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SELF-SACRIFICE</span><br />
<br />
One night a great mosque in Egypt, having
caught fire, was burnt. The Musulmans suspected
that Christians had committed the act,
and in revenge put fire to their houses, which
consumed them. The Sultán of Egypt had the
persons captured who burnt these houses, and
having assembled them in one spot, ordered notes
to be distributed among them, on some of which
a sentence of death to the bearer was written, on
some to cut off his hands, and on some to whip
him. These notes having been thrown to the
culprits and been picked up by them, each of them
underwent the punishment which had fallen to
his lot. One, to whom the sentence of death had
been awarded, said: "I do not fear to be killed,
but I have a mother, of whom no one will take
care except myself." Near him stood a man who
was to be punished by whippings but they exchanged
their notes, the latter saying: "I have
no mother, let me be killed instead of him, and him
be whipped instead of me," and this was done.</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">GALLANTRY AND HUMOUR</span><br />
<br />
An Arab of the desert welcomed the arrival
of an Arab chief in a Qasída recited by him,
which terminated in the following [Arabic]
distich:<br />
<br />
Stretch out thy hand to me, the palm whereof<br />
Distributes largesses, and its back is kissed.
</p>

<p class="block">Accordingly the generous man held out his hand
to be kissed by the Arab, whereon he said by
way of a joke: "The hairs upon thy lips have
scratched my hand." The Arab replied:
"What injury can the bristles of a porcupine
inflict upon the paw of a formidable lion?"
This sally pleased the liberal man, who said:
"I like this better than the Qasída," and ordered
him to be rewarded for it with 1,000 and for the
sally 3,000 <i>dirhams</i>.</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A LOVERS' DIALOGUE</span><br />
<br />
<i>Maiden:</i><br />
By God, who openly and secretly<br />
Is worshipped by men and fairies,<br />
I swear that of all whom I see in the world<br />
No one is dearer to me than thou.<br />
<br />
<i>Youth:</i><br />
O thou who sawest me, and residest in my heart,<br />
Soul and body, all now belong to thee.<br />
If my heart inclines to thee it is no wonder;<br />
It must be a stone, not a heart, which turns not to thee!<br />
</p>

<p class="block">'The girl said that now her only wish in the
world was that they should put their hands round
each other's waists, and eat sugar from the lips
of each other. The youth replied: "My desire
is the same, but what can I do? As God the
Most High says: 'The intimate friends on that
day shall be enemies unto one another, except
the pious,' which means that on the day of resurrection
friendship of friends will become enmity,
except the friendship of the abstemious, which
will increase the attachment. I do not wish
that on the morn of resurrection the edifice of
our love be impaired, and our friendship be
turned into enmity." After saying these words,
he departed, reciting the following:<br />
<br />
O heart, abandon this love of two days,<br />
Because a love of two days profits not;<br />
Choose a love wherewith on the day of reckoning<br />
Thou mayest abide in the eternal abode.<br />
</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A KIND FRIEND</span><br />
<br />
O heart, when a time of sorrow overtakes thee<br />
There will be no sorrow if thou hast a kind friend;<br />
For a day of trouble a friend is required,<br />
Because in times of comfort, friends are not scarce.<br />

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN</span><br />
<br />
A beautiful woman had many admirers, whose
attentions were so assiduous that the very street
in which she lived became thronged by her visitors,
but when her attractions disappeared and she
had become ugly, her lovers abandoned her.
Then I said to one of them: "She is the same
friend as before, with the same eyes, brows,
lips, but perhaps her stature is more tall and
her body more stout. It is faithless and treacherous
on thy part to neglect her." He replied:
"Alas for what thou sayest! That which
ravished the heart, and enthralled the senses,
was the spirit which resided in her form, in the
gracefulness of her limbs, the smoothness of her
skin, and in the pleasantness of her voice, but
as that spirit has departed from the figure, how
can I love a dead body, or fondle a withered
rose?"</p>

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">JOCULARITY</span><br />
<br />
If a contented man jokes, blame him not,<br />

The heart is a mirror, and vexation the rust on it:<br />
That rust is best polished away by jocularity.<br />

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A WEAVER AND A LEARNED PROFESSOR</span><br />
<br />
A weaver, who had left something in trust
with a learned man, desired again to have it
back some time afterwards, and going to ask
for it, he saw the man sitting in front of his
house on the professional couch, with a number
of his disciples in front of him. He said:
"Mullana, I am in need of my deposit." He
replied: "Wait an hour till I finish my lecture."
The weaver accordingly took a seat,
and, as the lecture proceeded, he observed that
the Mullana often shook his head; and thinking
that the imparting of the lesson consisted in
this, he said: "O professor, arise and let me
take thy place till thy return, and wag my
head till thou hast brought out my deposit,
because I am in haste."</p>


<p class="poet3">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">A WORD TO THE WISE</span><br />
<br />
If the gentleman fails to use the hair clipper<br />

But few days will elapse when his face<br />
Will, on account of the hair, pretend to be his head.<br />

<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE EXPLICIT BEGGAR</span><br />
<br />
A mendicant begged at the door of a house,
whereon the landlord apologised, saying that the
people had gone out, and the beggar rejoined:
"I want a morsel of bread, and net the people
of the house."</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PHANTOM RELATIONS</span><br />
<br />
A man was visited by a stranger who began
complaining, and said: "Is it possible that
thou knowest me not, and dost not consider my
claims upon thee?" The man was amazed, and
replied: "I know nothing of what thou sayest."
He continued: "My father desired to wed thy
mother, and if he had married her we would be
brothers." The man rejoined: "By Allah!
This relationship will be the occasion for my
becoming thy heir, and thou mine!"</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">AN OLD HAG WHO DESIRED ONLY PLEASURE</span><br />
<br />
A man said his prayers and then began his
supplications, desiring to enter Paradise and to
be delivered from the fire of Hell. An old woman,
who happened to be in his rear, and heard him,
said: "O Lord, cause me to share in whatever
he supplicates for." The man, who had listened,
then said: "O Lord, hang me on a gibbet, and
cause me to die of scourging." The hag continued:
"O Lord, pardon me and preserve
me from what he asked for." The man then
turned to her and said: "What a wonderfully-unpleasant
partner this is! She desires to share
with me in all that gives rest and pleasure, but
refuses to be my partner in distress and misery."</p>



<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PLAGIARISM</span><br />
<br />
A poet brought to a critic a composition, every
distich of which he had plagiarised from a different
collection of poems, and every rhetorical figure
from another author. The critic said: "For
a wonder thou hast brought a line of camels,
but if the string were untied, every one of the
herd would rush away in another direction."</p>


<p class="block">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE AFFLICTED POET</span><br />
<br />
A poet paid a visit to a doctor, and said:
"Something has become knotted in my heart
which makes me uncomfortable; it makes also
my limbs wither, and causes the hairs on my
body to stand on end." The physician, who was
a shrewd man, asked: "Very likely thou has not
yet recited to any one thy latest verses." The
poet replied: "Just so." The doctor continued:
"Then recite them." He complied, was requested
to repeat them, and again to rehearse
them for the third time. After he had done so,
the doctor said: "Now arise, for thou art
saved. This poetry had become knotted in thy
heart, and the dryness of it took effect upon
the outside; but, as thou hast relieved thy heart,
thou art cured."</p>
